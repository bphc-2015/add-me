Contact Sharing Service

## Description

Often among large groups, you find yourself taking a large sheet of paper and passing it around for everyone to write their phone numbers on it.... Let's simplify that tedious process. People volunteer their contacts to our service in groups and anyone who adds themselves to the group can save all other contacts in their phone/on Google account with a single tap/click. Like the previous one, android and web interfaces plus a backend service to handle the logic.
